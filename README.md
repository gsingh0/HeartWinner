some edge cases to consider
 - when one button is pressed, disable it so user can't press it multiple times
    - when action is done executing, re-enable the button
 - when button 1 is pressed with action 1, and user presses button 2 to trigger 
   action 2, first stop action 1, wait 2-3 seconds, then start action 2
 - have a settings screen with only logout option
 - login screen
 - home screen just going to be a scroll view of buttons
    - with each button pressed, will change the color of background
